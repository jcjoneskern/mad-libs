  Once upon a time, there was a very tired bootcamp class at <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.school}}</span> Circus studying <span>{{completedLibs.language}}</span>. It was about halfway through the program, and the class was deep into learning Angular <span>{{completedLibs.language}}</span> and struggling with it. "Aw, <span>{{completedLibs.shucks}}</span>!" said the class. "If only we had more time to learn this! No matter how much we <span>{{completedLibs.verb}}</span>, it's just not intuitive! Why can't everything make as much sense as <span>{{completedLibs.framework}}</span>?"
</p>
<p>
  "Don't worry, my <span>{{completedLibs.classdesc}}</span> class," said their instructor, <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.name}}</span>. "I have just the solution for all your problems." Unexpectedly, <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.name}}</span> pulled a <span>{{completedLibs.small}}</span> device out of their pocket. "I have a time machine!"
</p>
<p>
  The class was skeptical. "Prove it," a student demanded.
</p>
<p>
  "As you wish," said <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.name}}</span>, pushing a button on the device.
</p>
<p>
  The class was <span>{{completedLibs.surprised}}</span>. Pedestrians on the street below froze in their tracks. The clocks on their phones and computer stopped updating. "Alright," said <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.name}}</span>. "Open your books to page <span>{{completedLibs.number}}</span>."
</p>

  Before long, the students grew weary of the lesson. "This sucks!" they cried. "Angular <span>{{completedLibs.language}}</span> is too <span>{{completedLibs.framedesc}}</span>! Let's just move on."
</p>
<p>
  <span class="cap">{{completedLibs.name}}</span> pressed a button on the device and time returned to normal. "I know week 5 is rough," they said, "but trust me, it's best that we're getting this out of the way as quickly as possible."  The students nodded in agreement.
